# Objects Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create an `Object`
- Perform operations on an `Object`

## Introduction

We covered the concepts of `Object`s in JavaScript. Now it's time to put the
concepts into practice.

If you haven't already, **fork and clone** this lab into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code.

## Instructions

Follow the steps below, running `npm test` as you go to get additional
information from the tests. Don't forget to run `npm install` first!

Let's say we are working on a program that will keep track of a company's
employees. We want to store each `employee` as an `Object`. We're starting
small, so to begin with we'll only keep track of the employee's name and street
address.


After you have all the tests passing, remember to commit and push your changes
up to GitHub, then submit your work to Canvas using CodeGrade.

## Conclusion

In this lab, we practiced creating an `Object` and performing operations on it.
